/*
    Sometimes the element positioned in 3D (especially when it's moved back
    along Z axis) is not clickable, because it falls 'behind' the <body>
    element.

    To prevent this, I decided to make <body> non clickable by setting
    pointer-events property to `none` value.
    Value if this property is inherited, so to make everything else clickable
    I bring it back on the #impress element.

    If you want to know more about `pointer-events` here are some docs:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events

    There is one very important thing to notice about this workaround - it makes
    everything 'unclickable' except what's in #impress element.

    So use it wisely ... or don't use at all.

.impress-enabled          { pointer-events: none }
.impress-enabled #impress { pointer-events: auto }
